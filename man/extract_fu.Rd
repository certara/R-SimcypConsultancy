\title{Extract fu,plasma values that change with time from a Simulator output Excel
file. UNDER CONSTRUCTION!}
\usage{
extract_fu(
  sim_data_files,
  returnAggregateOrIndiv = "both",
  existing_exp_details = NA
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sim_data_files}{the Simcyp Simulator Excel results files containing the
simulated time-dependent fu data, in quotes}

\item{returnAggregateOrIndiv}{Return aggregate and/or individual simulated fu
data? Options are "individual", "aggregate", or "both" (default).
Aggregated data are not calculated here but are pulled from the simulator
output rows labeled as "mean".}

\item{existing_exp_details}{If you have already run
\code{\link{extractExpDetails_mult}} or \code{\link{extractExpDetails}} to
get all the details from the "Input Sheet" (e.g., when you ran
extractExpDetails you said \code{exp_details = "Input Sheet"} or
\code{exp_details = "all"}), you can save some processing time by supplying
that object here, unquoted. If left as NA, this function will run
\code{extractExpDetails} behind the scenes to figure out some information
about your experimental set up.}

\description{
\code{extract_fu} extracts the time-dependent fraction unbound in plasma from
a simulator output Excel file. A tab named something like "fu Profile (Sub)"
must be present. This currently only extracts data for the substrate, but if
you have an example with a different compound, please talk to Laura Shireman.
UNDER CONSTRUCTION!
