in a given folder and which XML observed overlay files were associated with
those simulation files}
\usage{
make_simulation_directory(
  project_folder = NA,
  sim_data_files = "recursive",
  simfile_path_option = "relative",
  existing_exp_details = NA,
  search_workspaces_for_obsfile = FALSE,

}
\arguments{
\item{project_folder}{location of the project folder to search. Please note
that R requires forward slashes ("/") in file paths rather than the back
slashes Microsoft uses. If left as NA (default), we'll assume your current
working directory is the top level of your project folder.}

\item{sim_data_files}{which files to include in the directory of simulations.
  This only applies when you don't supply anything for the argument
  \code{existing_exp_details}. Options are:
  \describe{

  \item{"recursive" (default)}{all .xlsx, .db, or .wksz files in the current folder and any
  subfolders}

  \item{NA}{all .xlsx, .db, or .wksz files in the current folder}

  \item{a single text string such as "dev"}{include any files in the current
  folder or any folders below it that have that specific text}

  \item{a character vector of specific file names, e.g., \code{sim_data_files =
  c("abc.xlsx", "def.xlsx")}}{only include the files listed. We'll figure
  out which folder they're in.}}}

\item{simfile_path_option}{How would you like to see the path for each
  simulation file? Options are: \describe{

  \item{"full path" ("full" also works)}{Show the entire path}

  \item{"relative" (default)}{Show the path relative to the project folder}}}

\item{existing_exp_details}{optionally supply the output from running
\code{\link{extractExpDetails_mult}} to get only the simulation files
included there in your simulation directory. If you supply something here,
whatever you supply for \code{sim_data_files} will be ignored. This will
also be used to figure out which XML files go with which simulations.}

\item{search_workspaces_for_obsfile}{TRUE or FALSE (default) for whether to
search through any workspace files and check for possible XML overlay
files. This runs considerably slower when set to TRUE and will take about
an additional 2 seconds per simulation. If you have supplied something for
'existing_exp_details', you don't need this and we'll ignore it if you set
this to TRUE.}

\item{include_possible_obsfiles}{TRUE (default) or FALSE for whether to
include in the output simulation directory possible XML
observed-data-overlay files. This will be ignored if you have supplied
something for the argument \code{existing_exp_details} because we'll just
figure out which observed files you have from that.}

\item{obsfile_path_option}{How would you like to see the observed overlay XML
  file path? Options are: \describe{

  \item{"full path" (default, "full" also works)}{Show the entire path}

  \item{"basename"}{Only show the file name (the basename)
  of the XML overlay file and NOT any of the path. Why would you want
  this? Say you've moved all your XML observed overlay files from their
  original locations when you ran the simulations into a new folder that
  you'll be sharing with the client at the end of the project. This way, you
  can show which simulation had which XML observed overlay file without the
  confusion of including the original path.}

  \item{"relative"}{Show the path relative to the project folder}}}

\item{figure_and_table_assignment}{optionally supply a data.frame of which
simulation file matches which figure and table in a report. We won't do
anything with this beyond use this information to fill in the column
"Table/Figure" in the simulation directory. To supply this information,
make a data.frame with a column titled "Filename", which must contain the
simulation file names (file extensions are optional and will ultimately be
ignored anyway) and a column titled "Table/Figure", which should contain
the name of any table or figure in a report that shows data from that
simulation file. Please use one row per simulation. If there are multiple
figures or tables for each simulation, you can either list one figure or
table per row or you can list them together, separated by commas. Here is
an example: \code{data.frame(File = c("01-abc.xlsx", "02-abc.xlsx",
"03-abc.xlsx", "03-abc.xlsx"), `Table/Figure` = c("Figure 1, Figure 2,
Table 1", "Figure 3", "Figure 4", "Table 2"))} The output from running
\code{\link{find_report_files}} will work great here. Any simulations that
are not present in your simulation directory will be ignored.}

\item{report_progress}{"yes", "no" (default), or "some" for whether to report
progress on reading workspaces to find observed XML overlay files. This
only applies when you have set \code{search_workspaces_for_obsfile} to
TRUE. Setting this to "yes" will report a message in the console for each
workspace as it is read. Setting this to "some" will report a message
saying when it has started and when it has finished reading workspaces, and
setting this to "no" will give no progress messages.}

\item{save_table}{optionally specify an Excel file name for saving your
simulation directory.}

\item{overwrite}{Should we overwrite if your Excel file already exists and
already has a tab named "Simulation directory"? Options are "yes" to always
overwrite, "no" to never overwrite, or "ask" (default), which means that we
will ask you whether to overwrite and give you a chance to supply a
different file name if the one you supplied already exists.}
}
\value{
a data.frame of simulation files and their respective file paths
}
\description{
The function \code{make_simulation_directory} will create a
  data.frame of simulations in a given project folder, the associated XML
  files when applicable (you'll have to provide that information with the
  argument \code{existing_exp_details} or else ask this function to read all
  the workspace files to find them), and, optionally, save that data.frame to
  an Excel file. It will also check whether the file names comply with USFDA
  and Consultancy Team standards and check whether the same simulation is
  saved in more than one place.

  This is wicked fast.*

  *Caveat: Unless you search all the workspaces for XML observed overlay data files. Then it
  takes about 2 seconds per simulation.
