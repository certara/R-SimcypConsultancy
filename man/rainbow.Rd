\usage{
rainbow(ncolors, shade = "regular")
}
\arguments{
\item{ncolors}{number of colors desired}

\item{shade}{the shade of colors to use, which can be "regular" (default),
"darker", "lighter", or "muted" (although "muted" in this case is the same
as "darker")}
}

a character vector of colors
}
\description{
\code{rainbow} is useful for getting a set of colors for graphs when you need
a LOT of colors; there are prettier and more easily distinguishable options
if you only have a couple of comparisons.
}
\examples{

rainbow(10)

# Try using scales::show_col() to visualize the colors, ex:
scales::show_col(rainbow(10))

}
