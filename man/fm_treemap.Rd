\title{For comparing fm values, make a treemap as opposed to the standard and
arguably inferior pie chart}
\usage{
fm_treemap(
  fm_dataframe,
  color_set = "default",
  label_fm_cutoff = 0.05,
  legend_nrow = NA,
  biggest_box_position = "bottom right",
  graph_title = NA,
  graph_title_size = 14,
  save_graph = NA,
  fig_height = 3,
  fig_width = 4
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fm_dataframe}{a data.frame containing columns for
\describe{\item{DME}{the drug-metabolizing enzyme} \item{fm}{the fraction
metaboilized}}}

\item{color_set}{the set of colors to use. Options are "default", which
matches Simcyp colors in PowerPoint presentations and is rather nice, "set
1" for Brewer set 1, "set 2" for Brewer set 2 (colorblind friendly),
"rainbow", which works well when there are a LOT of fm's to visualize,
"blue-green", which makes a pretty gradient of blues and greens, "blues",
which makes a graident of blues, or "viridis", which is from the eponymous
package by Simon Garnier and ranges colors from purple to blue to green to
yellow in a manner that is "printer-friendly, perceptually uniform and easy
to read by those with colorblindness", according to the package author.}

\item{label_fm_cutoff}{cutoff to use for having a label show up underneath
the graph; default is 0.05. You may want to play around with this a bit in
the final graphic file because how this graph looks is extremely dependent
on its dimensions.}

\item{legend_nrow}{optionally specify the number of rows to use for the
legend. If left as NA, there will be 1 row.}

\item{biggest_box_position}{where to put the biggest box. Defaults to "bottom
left", and other options are "top left", "bottom left", and "top right".}

\item{graph_title}{optionally specify a title that will be centered across
your graph}

\item{graph_title_size}{the font size for the graph title if it's included}

\item{save_graph}{optionally save the output graph by supplying a file name
in quotes here, e.g., "My conc time graph.png". If you do not designate a
file extension, it will be saved as a png file, but if you specify a
different file extension, it will be saved as that file format. Acceptable
extensions are "eps", "ps", "jpeg", "jpg", "tiff", "png", "bmp", or "svg".
Do not include any slashes, dollar signs, or periods in the file name.
Leaving this as NA means the file will not be automatically saved to disk.}

\item{fig_height}{figure height in inches; default is 3}

\item{fig_width}{figure width in inches; default is 4}

\description{
Create a treemap -- filled rectangles -- to indicate the fraction of
metabolism due to various pathways. Rectangles are proportional in size to
the fm values and include labels for the drug-metabolizing enzyme involved
and the percentage that enzyme is responsible for. Any rectangles that would
be smaller than some user-specified cutoff (see argument "label_fm_cutoff")
will be pulled out underneath the graph for readability. Why bother with a
treemap as opposed to a pie chart? Rectangles are easier to compare visually
than the sizes of pie slices, making a treemap easier to understand and
interpret (reference: "The Visual Display of Quantitative Information" by
Edward Tufte, Professor Emeritus of Political Science, Statistics, and
Computer Science at Yale University).
