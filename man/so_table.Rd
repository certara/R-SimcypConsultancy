so_table(
  report_input_file = NA,
  sheet = NA,

\arguments{
\item{report_input_file}{the name of the Excel file created by running
\code{\link{generateReportInputForm}}, including the path if it's in any
other directory than the current one, which you have now filled out}

\item{sheet}{the sheet in the Excel file that contains information about this
section of the report. In the original template, this was the tab titled
"table and graph input".}

\item{sectionInfo}{information about the simulated and observed data. This is
output from the function \code{\link{getSectionInfo}} and can be used
instead of listing the Excel file and sheet name as input.}

\item{sim_data_file}{the simulator output file. This is only necessary if you
are planning to leave blank the rows for the observed data values and fill
them in yourself.}

\item{PKparameters}{the PK parameters to include as a character vector. For a
full list of options, please see the help file for \link{\code{extractPK}}
to see all possible options. By default, the PK parameters included are
only those included in the observed data, but if no observed data are
included, the PK parameters will be automatically selected. An example of
acceptable input here: \code{c("AUCtau_ss", "AUCtau_ss_withInhib",
"Cmax_ss", "Cmax_ss_withInhib", "AUCtau_ratio_ss", "Cmax_ratio_ss")}}

\item{mean_type}{Arithmetic or geometric means? Only specify this if you'd
like to override the value listed in \code{sectionInfo}. If no value is
specified here or in \code{sectionInfo}, the default is "geometric".}

\item{variability_option}{What type of variability would you like the table
to include? Options are: "90\% CI", "95\% CI", "95th percentiles", or any
combination of those, e.g. \code{variability_option = c("90\% CI", "95th
percentiles"). The arithmetic CV will automatically be included.}}

\item{concatVariability}{Would you like to have the variability concatenated?
TRUE or FALSE. If "TRUE", the output will be formatted into a single row
and listed as the lower confidence interval or percentile to the upper CI
or percentile. Ex: "2400 to 2700"}

\item{includeHalfLife}{TRUE or FALSE for whether to include half life as a
parameter in the output table}

\item{includeTrialMeans}{TRUE or FALSE for whether to include the range of
trial means for a given parameter. Note: This is calculated from individual
values rather than pulled directly from the output.}

\item{includeCV}{TRUE or FALSE for whether to include rows for CV in the
table}
}
\value{
a data.frame
}
\description{
\code{so_table} creates simulated vs. observed tables for reports and
presentations, including reporting means, CVs, confidence intervals or
percentiles, and ratios of simulated vs. observed mean values. There are two
main ways to approach using this function 1. Select which data you want to
compare (\code{PKparameters} argument) and leave blank rows for observed data
to fill in later and calculate by hand, or 2. Fill out an Excel form with
information about your observed data. Setting up the input for this approach
requires a few steps:\enumerate{\item{Use the function
\code{\link{generateReportInputForm}} to create an Excel file where you can
enter information about your project.} \item{Go to the tab "observed data"
and enter details about your observed data. It's ok if you don't have all the
information; anything that's missing won't be included in the final S/O
table. It's also ok to rename this tab and/or make copies of it within the
same Excel file for making other S/O tables.} \item{Go to the tab "table and
graph input" and fill out information here for the specific report section
you're making this S/O table for. Make sure that whatever you list as the tab
that contains information about the observed data is exactly the same as the
actual tab name that you filled out in step 2. Also make sure that the file
names include the full file path.}\item{Save your Excel file.} \item{Here,
within RStudio (or within the shiny app that we plan to make!), run this
function using the name of that Excel file as input for
\code{report_input_file} and the name of the "table and graph input" tab as
the input for \code{sheet}. Note: If the Excel file lives on SharePoint,
you'll need to close it or this function will just keep running and not
generate any output while it waits for access to the file.} }
