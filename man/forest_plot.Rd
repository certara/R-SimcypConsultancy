\arguments{
\item{forest_dataframe}{a data.frame with extracted forest-plot data,
generated from running \code{\link{extractForestData}} on Simulator output
files or a csv or Excel file with the same data. (If it's an Excel file, it
must have only one tab.)}

\item{y_axis_labels}{a column in \code{forest_dataframe} (unquoted) or a
named character vector (each item in quotes) to use for labeling the
simulations on the y axis. In all forest plots, the y axis will be broken
up by the simulation file name behind the scenes, but that's likely not the
prettiest way to label the y axis, which is where this argument comes in.
If you already have a column in \code{forest_dataframe} with the label you
want -- for example the column Inhibitor1 when your drug of interest is a
victim or Substrate when it's the effector -- use that by specifying, for
example, \code{y_axis_labels = Inhibitor1}. If you would like to manually
specify which simulation file should be labeled what here, do so with a
named character vector, e.g.,
\code{y_axis_labels = c("myfile1.xlsx" = "itraconazole", "myfile2.xlsx" =
"efavirenz")}. If left as NA, we'll use the simulation file names. You can
optionally make the compound names prettier with the argument
\code{prettify_ylabel}.}

\item{y_order}{optionally set the order of simulation files on the y axis. If
  \code{y_order} is left as NA, the y axis will be sorted according to the
  AUC ratio with inhibitors on top and inducers on the bottom. If you would
  like to use some other order, there are four possible ways to
  specify this: \describe{

  \item{"as is"}{If you're already happy with the order of things in the
  input data \code{forest_dataframe}, then setting \code{y_order = "as is"}
  will keep things in exactly the same order.}

  \item{a character vector of file names}{e.g., \code{y_order =
  c("myfile1.xlsx", "myfile2.xlsx")}. The file names will be automatically
  replaced with whatever you specified for \code{y_axis_labels}.}

  \item{"strongest inhibitor to strongest inducer"}{Sort the simulations
  from top to bottom by AUC ratio from the strongest inhibitor (largest AUC
  ratio) to the strongest inducer (smallest AUC ratio). (The Cmax ratio will
  be used if you didn't include AUC.) This is the default option and what you
  get when \code{y_order} is left as NA.}

  \item{"strongest inducer to strongest inhibitor"}{Sort the simulations
  from top to bottom by AUC ratio from the strongest inducer (smallest AUC
  ratio) to the strongest inhibitor (largest AUC ratio). (The Cmax ratio will
  be used if you didn't include AUC.)}

  }}

\item{PKparameters}{optionally specify which PK parameters in
\code{forest_dataframe} to use as input. If left as NA, all the PK
parameters included in \code{forest_dataframe} will be included. If you try
to include a parameter that's not already present in
\code{forest_dataframe}, it will be ignored. User a character vector here,
e.g., \code{PKparameters = c("AUCinf_dose1", "Cmax_dose1")}}

\item{observed_PK}{observed PK data, with the following columns: \describe{

  \item{File}{the file you'd like the observed data to be graphed
  next to. Note that this file name must exist in the simulated data
  (forest_dataframe).}

  \item{PKparameter}{the specific PK parameters to graph. Acceptable values
  are: "AUCinf_ratio_dose1", "AUCt_ratio_dose1", "AUCinf_ratio",
  "Cmax_ratio_dose1", "Cmax_ratio_last", or "Cmax_ratio". Whatever you use
  must match what was listed in the simulated data to be included in the
  graph.}

  \item{at least one column named "Mean", "GeoMean", or "Median"}{Must be
  specified depending on your choice for \code{mean_type}, this column will
  be used for determining where to place the point. Whatever statistic you
  use \strong{must} be the same for both observed and simulated data.}

  \item{(optional) at least one column or set of columns named "CI_Lower", "CI_Upper",
  "Centile_Lower", "Centile_Upper", "GeoCV", "ArithCV", "Min", "Max",
  "Std Dev"}{these will be used for the error bars and are optional.}

  \item{whatever column you used for facet_column_x}{If you broke up the
  main graphs into two smaller graphs along the x axis, then whatever column you used for that
  must be present in the observed data, too.}

  }}

\item{facet_column_x}{optionally break up the graph horizontally into small
multiples. The designated column name should be unquoted, e.g.,
\code{facet_column_x = Dose_sub}. This would also allow you to potentially
use the same value for \code{y_axis_labels} for multiple simulations. For
example, say you have one simulation -- "SimA.xlsx" -- where the substrate
was dosed QD and another simulation -- "SimB.xlsx" -- where it was dosed
BID, and both of them were co-administered with the inhibitor itraconazole.
You want the y axis labels to show what effector was used in each
simulation, and both of these used the same inhibitor. If you break up your
graphs by setting \code{facet_column_x} to whatever column you used to
indicate the dosing regimen, then "SimA.xlsx" and "SimB.xlsx" won't overlap
on the graph even though they both had the same effector. That's the reason
it's ok here. Unclear? Please check out the examples at the bottom,
particularly the ones that employ \code{facet_column_x}.}

\item{show_numbers_on_right}{TRUE or FALSE (default) for whether to show the
numbers used for the centre statistic (the point) and any variability (the
error bars). This \emph{only} works when the graph has not been facetted
along the x direction. If it's facetted along the x direction, it wouldn't
be clear which numbers belonged to which facet. There's a way around this
limitation, though; please see the examples pertaining to
\code{show_numbers_on_right}.}

\item{mean_type}{type of mean to graph; options are "geometric" (default),
"arithmetic", or "median", but this only works when those data are included
in \code{forest_dataframe}. If you list the mean type as "mean", we'll
assume you want arithmetic means.}

\item{variability_type}{type of variability to show as whiskers; options are
"90\% CI" (default), "95\% CI", "5th to 95th percentiles", "range",
"geometric CV", "arithmetic CV", or "standard deviation" ("sd" is also ok
for that last one).}

\item{x_axis_limits}{the x axis limits to use; default is 0.06 to 12.}

\item{x_axis_title}{optionally supply a character vector or an expression to
use for the x axis title}

\item{x_axis_number_type}{set the x axis number type to be "ratios"
(default), "percents" (converts the ratios to a percent), or "keep trailing
zeroes" (still uses ratios but, unlike the default, guesses at a reasonable
number of digits to include based on the range of the data and includes
trailing zeroes as necessary)}

\item{x_order}{optionally specify the order in which the x-axis facets should
appear. For example, if you \code{facet_column_x} is the dosing regimen and
the values there are "QD" and "BID", the default will be to show them in
alphabetical order. If you want "QD" to show up first, though, set the
order with \code{x_order = c("QD", "BID")}}

\item{y_axis_title}{optionally specify a vertical title to be displayed to
the left of the y axis. Example: \code{y_axis_title = "Effector
co-administered with Drug X"}. Default ("none") leaves off any y-axis title.}

\item{pad_y_axis}{optionally add a smidge of padding to the y axis (default
is TRUE, which includes some generally reasonable padding). If set to
FALSE, the y axis tick marks will be placed closer to the top and bottom of
your data. If you want a \emph{specific} amount of y-axis padding, set this
to a number; the default is \code{c(0.2, 0)}, which adds 20\% more space to
the bottom and nothing to the top of the y axis. If you only specify one
number, we'll assume that's the percent you want added to the bottom.}

\item{legend_position}{specify where you want the legend to be. Options are
"left", "right", "bottom", "top", or "none" (default) if you don't want one
at all.}

\item{color_set}{the set of colors to use for shading the graph background to
  indicate the level of interaction depicted. Options are: \describe{
  \item{"grays" (default)}{white for values close to 1 and progressively
   darker grays for values with ratios outside of 1.25, 2, or 5 fold}

   \item{"yellow to red"}{makes graphs like Figure 1 of
  \href{https://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/psp4.12864}{Chen
  Jones 2022 CPT, doi 10.1002/psp4.12864}}

  \item{"green to red"}{uses the same colors as "yellow to red" except that
  the range of values around 1 will be a light green instead of white}

  \item{"none"}{no shading at all}

  \item{a named character vector of the colors you want for each interaction
  level}{e.g., \code{color_set = c("insignificant" = "white",
  "weak" = "gray90", "moderate" = "gray75", strong = "gray50")}}} The cutoff
  values (1.25, 2, or 5 fold) match those in "Clinical Drug Interaction
  Studies -- Cytochrome P450 Enzyme- and Transporter-Mediated Drug
  Interactions: Guidance for industry", US Food and Drug Administration
  Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, 2020, p. 19.}

\item{point_shape}{the shape of the points to show for the center statistic
(e.g., the geometric mean). The default is to show a white triangle for
observed data and a white circle for simulated data, so \code{point_shape =
c(24, 21)}. Any shapes used in R graphs will work; see options by typing
\code{ggpubr::show_point_shapes()} into the console. If you have both
simulated and observed data, enter two shapes with the first being the
shape for the observed data and the second being the shape for the
simulated data. If you have only simulated data, enter only one. If you
enter more shapes than your graph requires, the extras will be ignored.}

\item{graph_title}{optionally specify a title that will be centered across
the graph}

\item{graph_title_size}{the font size for the graph title if it's included;
default is 14.}

\item{table_title}{if you have included a table of the numbers by setting
\code{show_numbers_on_right = TRUE}, optionally specify what to use for the
title above those numbers. Setting this to NA (default) will result in a
title of what the numbers are, so basically the same text as the default
for the x axis, e.g., "Geometric Mean Ratio (90\% CI)". Otherwise, specify
what text you'd like to use. Setting this to "none" will remove the table
title.}

\item{rel_widths}{specify the relative widths of the graph and the table
(only applies if you included a table on the right side of the graph) as a
numeric vector. The default makes the graph 5x larger than the table, and
acceptable input looks like this: \code{rel_widths = c(5, 1)}}

\item{prettify_ylabel}{NA (default), TRUE, or FALSE on whether to attempt to
make text included in \code{y_axis_labels} prettier. This was designed for
the situation where the y axis is labeled with the compound used in the
simulation and where the substrates or effectors are among the standard
options for the simulator. Setting \code{prettify_ylabel =
TRUE} will make the name of those compounds something more human readable.
For example, "SV-Rifampicin-MD" will become "rifampicin", and
"Sim-Midazolam" will become "midazolam". If you leave this as NA, we'll
prettify if you supply a column name for \code{y_axis_labels} and we
*won't* prettify if you supply a named character vector there.}

\item{include_dose_num}{NA (default), TRUE, or FALSE on whether to include
the dose number when listing the PK parameter. By default, the parameter
will be labeled, e.g., "Dose 1 Cmax ratio" or "Last dose AUCtau ratio", if
you have PK data for both the first dose and the last dose. Also by
default, if you have data only for the first dose or only for the last
dose, the dose number will be omitted and it will be labeled, e.g., "AUCtau
ratio" or "Cmax ratio". Set this to TRUE or FALSE as desired to override
the default behavior and get exactly what you want.}

\item{include_ratio_in_labels}{TRUE (default) or FALSE on whether to include
"ratio" in the labels for the PK parameters.}

\item{error_bar_height}{optionally specify a number for the height of the
line at the end of the error bar. If left as NA, it will be set to 0.3. If
set to 0, the error bars will be just lines. Try it and you'll see what we
mean.}

\item{show_borders}{TRUE (default) or FALSE for whether to show a light gray
line between the files on the y axis. Note: This works best when
\code{color_set = "none"}. Otherwise, you'll be able to see what looks like
a very thin white line between the graphs that is actually the space
between the panels of the graph for each file. We can't quite eliminate
that tiny space.}

\item{vline_at_1}{specify the type of vertical line to show where the ratio =
1; default is to show a gray dashed line, and you can get no line by
specifying \code{vline_at_1 = "none"}. Acceptable input is the color (any
R-acceptable color will do) and then the line type separated by spaces,
e.g. "gray dashed" or "red dotted". To see all the possible line types,
type this into the console: \code{ggpubr::show_line_types()}. If you also
list a number, e.g., \code{vline_at_1 = "blue longdash 0.5"}, we'll set
that for the line thickness. Default line thickness is 0.5.}

\item{dose_units}{the units used in dosing, which only applies if you set
\code{facet_column_x}, to Dose_sub or Dose_inhib. In that situation,
setting the dose units here will automatically add those units to the
appropriate graph labels. This way, the graph label will be, e.g., "50 mg"
and "100 mg" instead of just "50" and "100". This just helps make it
clearer what the numbers represent. If you specify anything other than
Dose_sub or Dose_inhib for \code{facet_column_x}, this will be ignored.}

\item{save_graph}{optionally save the output graph by supplying a file name
in quotes here, e.g., "My forest plot.png" or "My forest plot.docx". If you
leave off ".png" or ".docx" from the file name, it will be saved as a png
file, but if you specify a different graphical file extension, it will be
saved as that file format. Acceptable graphical file extensions are "eps",
"ps", "jpeg", "jpg", "tiff", "png", "bmp", or "svg". Do not include any
slashes, dollar signs, or periods in the file name. Leaving this as NA
means the file will not be saved to disk.}

\item{fig_height}{figure height in inches; default is 6}

\item{fig_width}{figure width in inches; default is 5}
}
\value{
Output is a graph.

\description{
\code{forest_plot} creates a forest plot of AUC and Cmax ratios. Please use
the function \code{\link{extractForestData}} or \code{\link{pksummary_mult}}
(set the argument "extract_forest_data" to TRUE) to generate the input data
for \code{forest_dataframe}. In the graph, data will be broken up on the y
axis by the simulation file name and, optionally, anything you specify for
\code{facet_column_x}, which will be broken up along the x axis. Since file
names do not generally make the most lovely of y axis labels, please use the
argument \code{y_axis_labels} to specify how you'd like your y
axis to look. \strong{If you're a little confused here or you're just the
