\arguments{
\item{untidy_data}{a data.frame to be tidied or a csv file with the untidy
data or an Excel file with the untidy data. This should be in quotes.}

\item{untidy_data_sheet}{if you supplied an Excel file with the untidy data,
specify what sheet to read here. This should be in quotes.}

\item{cohort_column}{the column in the observed concentration-time data.frame
that contains the cohorts, unquoted}

\item{subject_column}{the column in the observed concentration-time
data.frame that contains the subject IDs, unquoted.}

\item{time_column}{the column in the untidy data.frame that contains times,
unquoted.}

\item{DV_column}{the column in the untidy data.frame that contains
concentration data, unquoted.}

\item{analyte_column}{the column in the untidy data.frame that contains the
analytes, unquoted.}

\item{dose_column}{the column in the untidy data.frame that contains the
doses, unquoted.}

\item{day_column}{the column in the untidy data.frame that contains the days,
unquoted.}

\item{age_column}{the column in the untidy data.frame that contains the ages,
unquoted.}

\item{weight_column}{the column in the untidy data.frame that contains the
weights, unquoted.}

\item{height_column}{the column in the untidy data.frame that contains
heights, unquoted.}

\item{sex_column}{the column in the untidy data.frame that contains sexes,
unquoted.}

\item{SDSE_column}{the column in the untidy data.frame that contains the
standard deviation or standard error, unquoted.}

\item{injection_site_column}{the column in the untidy data.frame that
contains the injection site, unquoted.}

\item{dose_unit}{the unit of dosing. Options are "mg" (default), "mg/m2", or
"mg/kg".}

\item{weighting}{weighting to use for parameter estimation. Defaults to 1.}

\item{split_columns}{Which columns should the data be split up by? This
\emph{should} be quoted. Apologies for the difference here since the other
column assignments are \emph{un}quoted, but, since this can have multiple
columns, the coding is easiest to do if these are in quotes. We're trying
to figure out how to get around that.}

\item{save_csv}{optionally specify a file name for saving the tidied data as
a csv. If you have more than one dose level in the data, the files will be
split up by dose level, and we'll include a suffix with the dose amount at
the end of the file name.}
