\title{Convert a page from a pdf file to a csv file}
\usage{
pdf_to_csv(pdf_file, page, save_csv = "csv")
}
\arguments{
\item{pdf_file}{the pdf file you want to read, in quotes, e.g.,
\code{pdf_file = "Table data that I want to graph but is in pdf form.pdf"}}

\item{page}{page number(s) of the pdf you want to read as a numeric vector.
For example, to read page 10, use \code{page = 10}. To read pages 1, 3, and
5 and put them into a single csv file: \code{page = c(1, 3, 5)}. To read
pages 9 through 12: \code{page = 9:12}. If you use multiple pages, keep in
mind that, if the columns don't line up well in the pdf, they also won't
line up well in the output csv file.}

\item{save_csv}{optionally specify a file name for saving the output. If left
as "csv", the file name will be the pdf file name plus the 1st page number
requested. If set to NA, no file will be saved.}
}
\value{
a data.frame of pdf table content
}
\description{
\code{pdf_to_csv} takes as input a pdf file and a page number and converts
that to a data.frame and, optionally, saves that to a csv file. This can be
useful for getting client-supplied data into a useful format. NOTE: This
requires the package pdftools, which you may have to download and install
with \code{install.packages("pdftools")}. You only have to do that once.
