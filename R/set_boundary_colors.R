#' INTERNAL: Create a set of boundary colors based on the color set and the
#' boundaries the user needs.
#'
#' @param color_set either a single value, e.g., "red green" or a character
#'   vector of colors. Acceptable single-value color set names:\describe{
#'   \item{"yellow to red"}{for highlighting in PK tables}
#'
#'   \item{"green to red"}{for highlighting in PK tables}
#'
#'   \item{"traffic"}{for highlighting in PK tables}
#'
#'   \item{"red black"}{for S/O boundary lines or fill}
#'
#'   \item{"red green"}{for S/O boundary lines or fill}
#'
#'   \item{"muted red green"}{for S/O boundary lines or fill}}
#'
#' @param break_type What type of breaks are these? Options are "GMR" (there
#'   will only be 4 and the output will be a named character vector for the
#'   intensity of the DDI), "SO highlight" (default) for S/O values in tables,
#'   and "SO line" for coloring the lines in S/O graphs. This distinction
#'   between "SO highlight" and "SO line" arises because the colors for the
#'   lines in the S/O graphs generally should have the 1st color repeated
#'   whereas the highlighting for tables should \emph{not} have any repeats. At
#'   present, "yellow to red", "traffic", and "green to red" are only available
#'   for break_types of "GMR" or "SO highlight". "red black", "red green", and
#'   "muted red green" are only available for a break_type of "SO line".
#'
#' @return a character vector of colors, one for each numeric boundary
#'
#' @examples
#' # None. Internal use only.
