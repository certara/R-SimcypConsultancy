#' Concentration-time plots to match Consultancy template
#'
#' Using observed and simulated concentration-time data generated from the
#' function \code{\link{extractConcTime}}, make publication-quality graphs that
#' match the consultancy template formatting instructions. We've tried to
#' include a fair number of options here for flexibility, but many of the
#' function arguments are optional; most of the time, you'll get decent-looking
#' graphs while only setting a minimal number of arguments. If you want to plot
#' enzyme abundance data, please see \code{\link{enz_plot}}. Please also see
#' "Details" at the bottom of this help file for some general notes and advice
#' on how to use this function most effectively to get the graph you want.
#'
#' \strong{A few notes:} \enumerate{\item{Not all substrate metabolites,
#' inhibitors, or inhibitor metabolites are available in all tissues. If it's
#' not present in your Excel output, we can't graph it here.}\item{When observed
#' data are included in a simulator output file, because the simulator output
#' does not explicitly say whether those observed data were in the presence of
#' an effector, this function cannot tell the difference and will thus assume
#' all observed data included in the simulator output were for the substrate in
#' the \emph{absence} of any effector. It will further assume that the compound
#' the observed data is for is the same as \code{compoundToExtract}. If you want
#' to specify which compound the observed data were for and/or whether any
#' effectors were present, please supply an observed data file to the argument
#' \code{obs_data_file}.} \item{If you attempt to use data generated by
#' \code{\link{extractConcTime_mult}} here, you can get weird results if you're
#' not careful to only include one tissue and one compound ID. If you see
#' something odd, try including the legend with, e.g., \code{legend_position =
#' "right"} to help decipher what might have gone awry.}}
#'
#' @param ct_dataframe the input concentration-time data generated by running
#'   the function \code{\link{extractConcTime}}. Not quoted.
#' @param subsection_ADAM ADAM model only: For ADAM model output, multiple types
#'   of data are available, so which of those types do you want to show? Options
#'   are whatever were available for that tissue, which could be "undissolved
#'   compound", "free compound in lumen", "Heff", "absorption rate", "unreleased
#'   compound in faeces", "dissolved compound", "luminal CLint", "cumulative
#'   fraction of compound absorbed", or "cumulative fraction of compound
#'   dissolved". Default is "free compound in lumen" but is ignored when
#'   ct_dataframe doesn't contain ADAM data.
#' @param figure_type type of figure to plot. Options are:
#'
#'   \describe{
#'
#'   \item{"percentiles"}{(default) plots an opaque line for the mean data,
#'   lighter lines for the 5th and 95th percentiles of the simulated data, and
#'   open circles for the observed data. If an effecter were present, the
#'   default is dashed lines for the data in the presence of an effector.}
#'
#'   \item{"trial means"}{plots an opaque line for the mean data, lighter lines
#'   for the mean of each trial of simulated data, and open circles for the
#'   observed data. If an effector were present, lighter dashed lines indicate
#'   the mean of each trial of simulated data in the presence of the effector.}
#'
#'   \item{"percentile ribbon"}{plots an opaque line for the mean data,
#'   transparent shading for the 5th to 95th percentiles of the simulated data,
#'   and open circles for the observed data. If an effector were present, the
#'   default is to show the data without the effector in blue and the data in
#'   the presence of the effector in red. Note: You may sometimes see some
#'   artifacts -- especially for semi-log plots -- where the ribbon gets partly
#'   cut off. For arcane reasons we don't want to bore you with here, we can't
#'   easily prevent this. However, a possible fix is to set your y axis limits
#'   for the semi-log plot to be wider using \code{y_axis_limits_log}.}
#'
#'   \item{"means only"}{plots a black line for the mean data and, if an
#'   effector was modeled, a dashed line for the concentration-time data with
#'   Inhibitor 1.}
#'
#'   \item{"Freddy"}{Freddy's favorite style of plot with trial means in light
#'   gray, the overall mean in thicker black, the 5th and 95th percentiles in
#'   dashed lines, and the observed data in semi-transparent purple-blue. Graphs
#'   with an effector present lose the trial means, and the percentiles switch
#'   to solid, gray lines. \strong{An editorial comment:} While this does not
#'   align with the officially sanctioned template at this time, this looks
#'   \emph{sharp}, makes it easy to see the defining characteristics of the
#'   data, and I recommend checking it out, even just for your own purposes of
#'   examining your data. If the color is too much for you but you like the
#'   rest, try setting \code{obs_color = "black", obs_shape = c(1, 2)}. -LSh}}
#'
#' @param mean_type graph "arithmetic" (default) or "geometric" means or
#'   "median" for median concentrations. If that option was not included in the
#'   output, you'll get a warning and the graph will include one that was.
#' @param time_range time range to show relative to the start of the simulation.
#'   Options: \describe{
#'
#'   \item{NA}{(default) entire time range of data}
#'
#'   \item{a start time and end time in hours}{only data in that time range,
#'   e.g. \code{c(24, 48)}. Note that there are no quotes around numeric data.}
#'
#'   \item{"first dose"}{only the time range of the first dose}
#'
#'   \item{"last dose"}{only the time range of the last dose}
#'
#'   \item{"penultimate dose"}{only the time range of the 2nd-to-last dose,
#'   which can be useful for BID data where the end of the simulation extended
#'   past the dosing interval or data when the substrate was dosed BID and the
#'   effector was dosed QD}
#'
#'   \item{a specific dose number with "dose" or "doses" as the prefix}{the time
#'   range encompassing the requested doses, e.g., \code{time_range = "dose 3"}
#'   for the 3rd dose or \code{time_range = "doses 1 to 4"} for doses 1 to 4}
#'
#'   \item{"all obs" or "all observed" if you feel like spelling it out}{Time
#'   range will be limited to only times when observed data are present.}
#'
#'   \item{"last dose to last observed" or "last obs" for short}{Time range will
#'   be limited to the start of the last dose until the last observed data
#'   point.}
#'
#'
#'   }
#'
#' @param t0 What event should be used for time zero? Options are: "simulation
#'   start" (default), "dose 1", "penultimate dose", or "last dose". \emph{This
#'   does not change which data are included in the graph;} instead, this
#'   determines whether the x axis numbers are offset so that, e.g., the last
#'   dose is administered at time 0.
#'
#' @param adjust_obs_time TRUE or FALSE (default) for whether to adjust the time
#'   listed in the observed data file to match the last dose administered. This
#'   only applies to multiple-dosing regimens. If TRUE, the graph will show the
#'   observed data overlaid with the simulated data such that the dose in the
#'   observed data was administered at the same time as the last dose in the
#'   simulated data. If FALSE, the observed data will start at whatever times
#'   are listed in the Excel file.
#' @param pad_x_axis optionally add a smidge of padding to the the x axis
#'   (default is TRUE, which includes some generally reasonable padding). If
#'   changed to FALSE, the y axis will be placed right at the beginning of your
#'   time range and all data will end \emph{exactly} at the end of the time
#'   range specified. If you want a \emph{specific} amount of x-axis padding,
#'   set this to a number; the default is \code{c(0.02, 0.04)}, which adds 2\%
#'   more space to the left side and 4\% more to the right side of the x axis.
#'   If you only specify one number, we'll assume that's the percent you want
#'   added to the left side.
#' @param pad_y_axis optionally add a smidge of padding to the y axis (default
#'   is TRUE, which includes some generally reasonable padding). As with
#'   \code{pad_x_axis}, if changed to FALSE, the x axis will be placed right at
#'   the bottom of your data, possible cutting a point in half. If you want a
#'   \emph{specific} amount of y-axis padding, set this to a number; the default
#'   is \code{c(0.02, 0)}, which adds 2\% more space to the bottom and nothing
#'   to the top of the y axis. If you only specify one number, we'll assume
#'   that's the percent you want added to the bottom.
#' @param x_axis_interval optionally set the x-axis major tick-mark interval.
#'   Acceptable input: any number or leave as NA to accept default values, which
#'   are generally reasonable guesses as to aesthetically pleasing and
#'   PK-relevant intervals.
#' @param x_axis_label optionally supply a character vector or an expression to
#'   use for the x axis label
#' @param y_axis_limits_lin optionally set the Y axis limits for the linear
#'   plot, e.g., \code{c(10, 1000)}. If left as the default NA, the Y axis
#'   limits for the linear plot will be automatically selected.
#' @param y_axis_limits_log optionally set the Y axis limits for the semi-log
#'   plot, e.g., \code{c(10, 1000)}. Values will be rounded down and up,
#'   respectively, to a round number. If left as the default NA, the Y axis
#'   limits for the semi-log plot will be automatically selected.
#' @param y_axis_label optionally supply a character vector or an expression to
#'   use for the y axis label
#' @param obs_color If you would like the observed data points to be in color,
#'   either specify a color here or set this to "default". Points will be
#'   displayed in semi-transparent blue-purple for "default" and the
#'   semi-transparent version of whatever other color you list otherwise.
#'   Setting this to "none" will remove observed data from the graph. Hex color
#'   codes are also ok to use. If left as NA, all observed data will be in black
#'   or, if you set something for \code{line_color}, whatever colors were used
#'   for that.
#' @param obs_shape optionally specify what shapes are used to depict observed
#'   data for 1. the substrate drug alone and 2. the substrate drug in the
#'   presence of an effector. Input should look like this, for example:
#'   \code{c(1, 2)} to get an open circle and an open triangle. To see all the
#'   possible shapes and what number corresponds to which shape, type
#'   \code{ggpubr::show_point_shapes()} into the console. If left as NA,
#'   substrate alone will be an open circle and substrate + inhibitor 1 will be
#'   an open triangle.
#' @param obs_size optionally specify the size of the points to use for the
#'   observed data. If left as NA, the size will be 2.
#' @param obs_fill_trans optionally specify the transparency for the fill of the
#'   observed data points, which can be helpful when you have a lot of points
#'   overlapping. This only applies when you have specified a value for
#'   \code{obs_color} since, for most of the graph types, the observed data is
#'   depicted as an open circle by default. Acceptable values are from 0 (fully
#'   transparent, so no fill at all) to 1 (completely opaque or black). If left
#'   as the default NA, the observed data points will be 50% transparent, so the
#'   same as if this were set to 0.5.
#' @param obs_line_trans optionally specify the transparency for the outline of
#'   the observed data points, which can be helpful when you have a lot of
#'   points overlapping. Acceptable values are from 0 (fully transparent, so no
#'   line at all) to 1 (completely opaque or black). If left as the default NA,
#'   the observed data points will be opaque, so the same as if this were set to
#'   1.
#' @param showBLQ TRUE or FALSE (default) to display observed concentrations
#'   that were clearly below the lower limit of quantitation, that is,
#'   concentrations equal to 0 after time 0. The default (FALSE) removes these
#'   values so that they will not show up on graphs.
#' @param line_transparency optionally specify the transparency for the trial
#'   mean or percentile lines. Acceptable values are from 0 (fully transparent,
#'   so no line at all) to 1 (completely opaque or black). If left as the
#'   default NA, this value will be automatically determined.
#' @param line_type Optionally specify what types of lines are used to depict
#'   \enumerate{\item{the substrate drug alone and} \item{the substrate drug in
#'   the presence of an effector (when applicable).}} Input should look like
#'   this, for example: \code{c("solid", "dashed")} to get a solid line for the
#'   substrate drug and a dashed line for inhibitor 1. \itemize{ \item{To see
#'   all possible \code{line_type} options: \code{ggpubr::show_line_types()}}
#'   \item{If left as NA, substrate alone will be a solid line and substrate +
#'   inhibitor 1 will be a dashed line.} \item{If \code{figure_type} is "Freddy"
#'   and there's no effector present, which is a slightly different scenario
#'   than the other graph types, the 1st line type specified will be for the
#'   mean simulated concentration and the trial means, and the 2nd line type
#'   specified will be for the 5th and 95th percentiles.}}
#' @param line_color optionally specify what colors to use for the lines.
#'   Acceptable input for, e.g., the substrate alone to be blue and the
#'   substrate + Inhibitor 1 to be red: \code{c("blue", "red")}. If left as the
#'   default NA, lines will be black or gray. Hex color codes are also
#'   acceptable to use.
#' @param line_width optionally specify how thick to make the lines. Acceptable
#'   input is a number; the default is 1 for most lines and 0.8 for some, to
#'   give you an idea of where to start.
#' @param graph_labels TRUE or FALSE for whether to include labels (A, B, C,
#'   etc.) for each of the small graphs. (Not applicable if only outputting
#'   linear or only semi-log graphs.)
#' @param graph_title optionally specify a title that will be centered across
#'   your graph or set of graphs
#' @param graph_title_size the font size for the graph title if it's included;
#'   default is 14
#' @param legend_label optionally indicate on the legend whether the effector is
#'   an inhibitor, inducer, activator, or suppressor. Input will be used as the
#'   label in the legend for the line style and the shape. If left as the
#'   default NA when a legend is included and an effector is present, the label
#'   in the legend will be "Inhibitor".
#' @param prettify_compound_names TRUE (default) or FALSE on whether to make
#'   compound names prettier in legend entries and in any Word output files.
#'   This was designed for simulations where the substrate and any metabolites,
#'   effectors, or effector metabolites are among the standard options for the
#'   simulator, and leaving \code{prettify_compound_names = TRUE} will make the
#'   name of those compounds something more human readable. For example,
#'   "SV-Rifampicin-MD" will become "rifampicin", and "Sim-Midazolam" will
#'   become "midazolam". Set each compound to the name you'd prefer to see in
#'   your legend and Word output if you would like something different. For
#'   example, \code{prettify_compound_names = c("inhibitor" = "teeswiftavir",
#'   "substrate" = "superstatin")}. Please note that "inhibitor" includes
#'   \emph{all} the effectors and effector metabolites present, so, if you're
#'   setting the effector name, you really should use something like this if
#'   you're including effector metabolites: \code{prettify_compound_names =
#'   c("inhibitor" = "teeswiftavir and 1-OH-teeswiftavir", "substrate" =
#'   "superstatin")}.
#' @param linear_or_log the type of graph to be returned. Options: \describe{
#'   \item{"semi-log"}{y axis is log transformed}
#'
#'   \item{"linear"}{no axis transformation}
#'
#'   \item{"both vertical"}{(default) both the linear and the semi-log graphs
#'   will be returned, and graphs are stacked vertically}
#'
#'   \item{"both horizontal"}{both the linear and the semi-log graphs will be
#'   returned, and graphs are side by side horizontally}
#'
#'   \item{"horizontal and vertical"}{both the linear and the semi-log graphs
#'   will be returned, and graphs are side by side horizontally (one graph; file
#'   name will end in "- horizontal") and stacked vertically (second graph; file
#'   name will end in "- vertical"). This option, which was designed to create
#'   the vertically stacked version of a graph for a report and the horizontal,
#'   side-by-side version for a presentation, is a bit different from the others
#'   since it will return two separate files. In the RStudio "Plots" window,
#'   you'll only see the vertically stacked version. Setting \code{fig_height}
#'   and \code{fig_width} will adjust only the dimensions of the horizontal
#'   figure; the default values will be used for the vertical one. If you
#'   request Word output, only the vertical plot will be saved in Word format;
#'   the horizontal plot will be saved as a png file.}}
#' @param legend_position specify where you want the legend to be. Options are
#'   "left", "right", "bottom", "top", or "none" (default) if you don't want one
#'   at all.
#' @param save_graph optionally save the output graph by supplying a file name
#'   in quotes here, e.g., "My conc time graph.png" or "My conc time
#'   graph.docx". The nice thing about saving to Word is that the figure title
#'   and caption text will be filled in automatically. If you leave off ".png"
#'   or ".docx", the graph will be saved as a png file, but if you specify a
#'   different graphical file extension, it will be saved as that file format.
#'   Acceptable graphical file extensions are "eps", "ps", "jpeg", "jpg",
#'   "tiff", "png", "bmp", or "svg". Leaving this as NA means the file will not
#'   be saved to disk. \strong{WARNING:} SAVING TO WORD DOES NOT WORK ON
#'   SHAREPOINT. This is a Microsoft permissions issue, not an R issue. If you
#'   try to save on SharePoint, you will get a warning that R will save your
#'   file instead to your Documents folder.
#' @param fig_height figure height in inches; default is 6
