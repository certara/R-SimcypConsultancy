#' Create a draft of DDI experimental and results sections in a report -- UNDER
#' CONSTRUCTION
#'
#' \code{draft_DDI_section} outputs a Word document that can be copied, pasted,
#' and further edited in a PBPK report. This is very much under construction and
#' works only with fairly quotidian scenarios.
#'
#' @param sim_data_file name of the Excel file containing the simulator output,
#'   in quotes
#' @param existing_exp_details NA (default) or the output from running either
#'   \code{\link{extractExpDetails}} or \code{\link{extractExpDetails_mult}} --
#'   either is fine as long as it contains details for \code{sim_data_file}. You
#'   must have set the argument \code{exp_details} to "all" when you extracted
#'   the simulator setup experimental details or \code{draft_DDI_section} won't
#'   work. If you did \emph{not} do that, leave this as NA to have it go ahead
#'   and do that for you. If you leave it as NA, it will extract exactly what
#'   information it needs but will take a smidge longer to run.
#' @param ct_dataframe NA (default) or a data.frame of concentration-time data
#'   generated by running the function \code{\link{extractConcTime}} or
#'   \code{\link{extractConcTime_mult}} -- either is fine as long as it contains
#'   \code{sim_data_file} and the tissue you want. Not quoted. If you leave this
#'   as NA, it will extract what it needs for you but it will take a smidge
#'   longer to run.
#' @param victim_sim TRUE (default) or FALSE for whether this was a victim DDI
#'   simulation, so "TRUE" means that the client's drug was the victim. The only
#'   thing this affects is the sentence in the template report text "Performance
#'   verification of the XXX model is provided in Appendix B - Performance
#'   Verification of CYP3A Substrates, Inhibitors and Inducers." If this was a
#'   victim DDI simulation, then this sentence will replace "XXX" with the name
#'   of the perpetrator. If not, it will replace "XXX" with the name of the
#'   substrate.
#' @param default_cmpd_file Was one of the default compound files used for the
#'   substrate (if this was a perpetrator simulation) or the perpetrator (if
#'   this was a victim simulation)? TRUE (default) or FALSE. The only thing this
#'   affects is the sentence in the template report text, "The default compound
#'   library file for XXX was used."
#' @param PKparameters (optional) the PK parameters to include as a character
#'   vector. \itemize{
#'
#'   \item{By default, if you have a single-dose simulation, the parameters will
#'   include AUC and Cmax for dose 1, and, if you have a multiple-dose
#'   simulation, AUC and Cmax for the last dose. Also by default, if you have an
#'   perpetrator present, the parameters will include the AUC and Cmax values with
#'   and without the perpetrator as well as those ratios.}
#'
#'   \item{Alternatively, you can specify a vector of any combination of
#'   specific, individual parameters, e.g., \code{c("Cmax_dose1",
#'   "AUCtau_last").} Be sure to encapsulate the parameters you want with
#'   \code{c(...)}! To see the full set of possible parameters to extract, enter
#'   \code{view(PKParameterDefinitions)} into the console.}
#'
#'   \item{If you supply observed data using either the argument
#'   \code{report_input_file} or the argument \code{observed_PK}, the only PK
#'   parameters that will be included are those available for the observed
#'   data.}
#'
#'   \item{Parameters that don't make sense for your scenario -- such as asking
#'   for \code{AUCinf_dose1_withInhib} when your simulation did not include an
#'   inhibitor or perpetrator -- will not be included.}
#'
#'   \item{tmax will be listed as median, min, and max rather than mean, lower
#'   and higher X\% confidence interval or X percentiles. Similarly, if you
#'   request trial means, the values for tmax will be the range of medians for
#'   the trials rather than the range of means.}}
#'
#'   An example of acceptable input here: \code{PKparameters = c("AUCtau_last",
#'   "AUCtau_last_withInhib", "Cmax_last", "Cmax_last_withInhib",
#'   "AUCtau_ratio_last", "Cmax_ratio_last")}.
#' @param observed_PK (optional) If you have a data.frame, a named numeric
#'   vector, or an Excel or csv file with observed PK parameters, supply the
#'   full file name in quotes or the data.frame or vector here, and the
#'   simulated-to-observed mean ratios will be calculated. If you supply an
#'   Excel file, it should have only one tab. We prefer supplying csv files here
#'   since they're faster to read in anyway. The supplied data.frame or file
#'   must include columns for each of the PK parameters you would like to
#'   compare, and those column names \emph{must} be among the PK parameter
#'   options listed in \code{PKParameterDefinitions}. If you would like the
#'   output table to include the observed data CV for any of the parameters, add
#'   "_CV" to the end of the parameter name, e.g., "AUCinf_dose1_CV". Please see
#'   the "Example" section of this help file for examples of how to set this up.
#' @param tissue the tissue to use for extracting PK data and for graphing.
#'   Options are "plasma" (default) or "blood".
#' @param fontsize the font size to use in the table. Default is 11.
#' @param include_dose_num NA (default), TRUE, or FALSE on whether to include
#'   the dose number when listing the PK parameter. By default, the parameter
#'   will be labeled, e.g., "Dose 1 Cmax ratio" or "Last dose AUCtau ratio", if
#'   you have PK data for both the first dose and the last dose. Also by
#'   default, if you have data only for the first dose or only for the last
#'   dose, the dose number will be omitted and it will be labeled, e.g., "AUCtau
#'   ratio" or "Cmax ratio". Set this to TRUE or FALSE as desired to override
#'   the default behavior and get exactly what you want.
#' @param mean_type_PK What kind of means and CVs do you want listed in the
#'   output PK summary table? Options are "arithmetic" or "geometric" (default).
#' @param mean_type_graph graph "arithmetic" (default) or "geometric" means or
#'   "median" for median concentrations in the concentration-time graph. If that
#'   option was not included in the output, you'll get a warning and the graph
#'   will include one that was.
#' @param figure_type_sub type of figure to plot for the substrate. Options are:
#'
#'   \describe{
#'
#'   \item{"percentiles"}{(default) plots an opaque line for the mean data,
#'   lighter lines for the 5th and 95th percentiles of the simulated data, and
#'   open circles for the observed data. If an effecter were present, the
#'   default is dashed lines for the data in the presence of a perpetrator.}
#'
#'   \item{"trial means"}{plots an opaque line for the mean data, lighter lines
#'   for the mean of each trial of simulated data, and open circles for the
#'   observed data. If a perpetrator were present, lighter dashed lines indicate
#'   the mean of each trial of simulated data in the presence of the perpetrator.}
#'
#'   \item{"percentile ribbon"}{plots an opaque line for the mean data,
#'   transparent shading for the 5th to 95th percentiles of the simulated data,
#'   and open circles for the observed data. If a perpetrator were present, the
#'   default is to show the data without the perpetrator in blue and the data in
#'   the presence of the perpetrator in red. Note: You may sometimes see some
#'   artifacts -- especially for semi-log plots -- where the ribbon gets partly
#'   cut off. For arcane reasons we don't want to bore you with here, we can't
#'   easily prevent this. However, a possible fix is to set your y axis limits
#'   for the semi-log plot to be wider using \code{y_axis_limits_log}.}
#'
#'   \item{"means only"}{plots a black line for the mean data and, if an
#'   perpetrator was modeled, a dashed line for the concentration-time data with
#'   Inhibitor 1.}
#'
#'   \item{"Freddy"}{Freddy's favorite style of plot with trial means in light
#'   gray, the overall mean in thicker black, the 5th and 95th percentiles in
#'   dashed lines, and the observed data in semi-transparent purple-blue. Graphs
#'   with a perpetrator present lose the trial means, and the percentiles switch
#'   to solid, gray lines. \strong{An editorial comment:} While this does not
#'   align with the officially sanctioned template at this time, this looks
#'   \emph{sharp}, makes it easy to see the defining characteristics of the
#'   data, and I recommend checking it out, even just for your own purposes of
#'   examining your data. If the color is too much for you but you like the
#'   rest, try setting \code{obs_color = "black", obs_shape = c(1, 2)}. -LSh}}
#' @param time_range_sub time range to show relative to the start of the
#'   simulation for the graph of the substrate. Options: \describe{
#'
#'   \item{NA}{entire time range of data}
#'
#'   \item{a start time and end time in hours}{only data in that time range,
#'   e.g. \code{c(24, 48)}. Note that there are no quotes around numeric data.}
#'
#'   \item{"first dose"}{only the time range of the first dose}
#'
#'   \item{"last dose"}{(default) only the time range of the last dose}
#'
#'   \item{"penultimate dose"}{only the time range of the 2nd-to-last dose,
#'   which can be useful for BID data where the end of the simulation extended
#'   past the dosing interval or data when the substrate was dosed BID and the
#'   perpetrator was dosed QD}
#'
#'   \item{a specific dose number with "dose" or "doses" as the prefix}{the time
#'   range encompassing the requested doses, e.g., \code{time_range = "dose 3"}
#'   for the 3rd dose or \code{time_range = "doses 1 to 4"} for doses 1 to 4}
#'
#'   \item{"all obs" or "all observed" if you feel like spelling it out}{Time
#'   range will be limited to only times when observed data are present.}
#'
#'   \item{"last dose to last observed" or "last obs" for short}{Time range will
#'   be limited to the start of the last dose until the last observed data
#'   point.}
#'
#'
#'   }
#' @param x_axis_interval_sub optionally set the x-axis major tick-mark interval
#'   for the graph of the substrate. Acceptable input: any number or leave as NA
#'   to accept default values, which are generally reasonable guesses as to
#'   aesthetically pleasing and PK-relevant intervals.
#' @param y_axis_label_sub optionally supply a character vector or an expression
#'   to use for the y axis label for the graph of the substrate
#' @param y_axis_limits_log_sub optionally set the Y axis limits for the
#'   semi-log plot for the graph of the substrate, e.g., \code{c(10, 1000)}.
#'   Values will be rounded down and up, respectively, to a round number. If
#'   left as the default NA, the Y axis limits for the semi-log plot will be
#'   automatically selected.
#' @param legend_label_sub optionally indicate on the legend of the graph of the
#'   substrate whether the perpetrator is an inhibitor, inducer, activator, or
#'   suppressor. Input will be used as the label in the legend for the line
#'   style and the shape. If left as the default NA when a legend is included
#'   and a perpetrator is present, the label in the legend will be "Inhibitor".
#' @param linear_or_log_sub the type of graph to be returned. Options:
#'   \describe{ \item{"semi-log"}{y axis is log transformed}
#'
#'   \item{"linear"}{no axis transformation}
#'
#'   \item{"both vertical"}{(default) both the linear and the semi-log graphs
#'   will be returned, and graphs are stacked vertically}
#'
#'   \item{"both horizontal"}{both the linear and the semi-log graphs will be
#'   returned, and graphs are side by side horizontally}
#'
#'   \item{"horizontal and vertical"}{both the linear and the semi-log graphs
#'   will be returned, and graphs are side by side horizontally (one graph; file
#'   name will end in "- horizontal") and stacked vertically (second graph; file
#'   name will end in "- vertical"). This option, which was designed to create
#'   the vertically stacked version of a graph for a report and the horizontal,
#'   side-by-side version for a presentation, is a bit different from the others
#'   since it will return two separate files. In the RStudio "Plots" window,
#'   you'll only see the vertically stacked version. Setting \code{fig_height}
#'   and \code{fig_width} will adjust only the dimensions of the horizontal
#'   figure; the default values will be used for the vertical one. If you
#'   request Word output, only the vertical plot will be saved in Word format;
#'   the horizontal plot will be saved as a png file.}}
#'
#' @param figure_type_inhib type of figure to plot for the substrate. Options
#'   are the same as for the substrate.
#' @param time_range_inhib time range to show relative to the start of the
#'   simulation for the graph of the inhibitor. Options are the same as for the
#'   substrate.
#' @param x_axis_interval_inhib optionally set the x-axis major tick-mark
#'   interval for the graph of the inhibitor. Acceptable input: any number or
#'   leave as NA to accept default values, which are generally reasonable
#'   guesses as to aesthetically pleasing and PK-relevant intervals.
#' @param y_axis_label_inhib optionally supply a character vector or an
#'   expression to use for the y axis label for the graph of the inhibitor
#' @param y_axis_limits_log_inhib optionally set the Y axis limits for the
#'   semi-log plot for the graph of the inhibitor, e.g., \code{c(10, 1000)}.
#'   Values will be rounded down and up, respectively, to a round number. If
#'   left as the default NA, the Y axis limits for the semi-log plot will be
#'   automatically selected.
#' @param linear_or_log_inhib the type of graph to be returned. Options are the
#'   same as for the substrate plot.
#'
#' @param clin_study_name the name of the clinical study for any observed data;
#'   this only shows up in the text describing the table and graph. Any quoted
#'   value is fine here. It will be listed as "Clinical Study X" where "X" is
#'   the value you supply for \code{clin_study_name}.
#' @param include_enz_plot TRUE or FALSE (default) for whether to include a
#'   graph of enzyme abundance data
#' @param enzyme the enzyme whose abundance should be shown in an
#'   enzyme-abundance plot, if one is included
#' @param prettify_compound_names TRUE (default) or FALSE on whether to make
#'   compound names prettier in legend entries and in any Word output files.
#'   This was designed for simulations where the substrate and any metabolites,
#'   perpetrators, or perpetrator metabolites are among the standard options for
#'   the simulator, and leaving \code{prettify_compound_names = TRUE} will make
#'   the name of those compounds something more human readable. For example,
#'   "SV-Rifampicin-MD" will become "rifampicin", and "Sim-Midazolam" will
#'   become "midazolam". Set each of "substrate" and "perpetrator" to the names
#'   you'd prefer to see in your legend and Word output if you would like
#'   something different. For example, \code{prettify_compound_names =
#'   c("substrate" = "superstatin", "perpetrator" = "teeswiftavir")}. Please note
#'   that "perpetrator" includes \emph{all} the perpetrators and perpetrator
#'   metabolites present, so, if you're setting the perpetrator name, you really
#'   should use something like this if you're including perpetrator metabolites:
#'   \code{prettify_compound_names = c("perpetrator" = "teeswiftavir and
#'   1-OH-teeswiftavir", "substrate" = "superstatin")}. (Order doesn't matter.)
#' @param save_draft the name of the Word file to use for saving the output. Do
#'   not include any slashes, dollar signs, or periods in the file name. If left
#'   as NA, this will be set to "Draft DDI report section for XXXX.docx" where
#'   "XXXX" is the name of the simulator output Excel file.
#' @param includeCV TRUE or FALSE (default) for whether to include rows for CV
#'   in the table
#' @param includeConfInt TRUE (default) or FALSE for whether to include whatever
#'   confidence intervals were included in the simulator output file. Note that
#'   the confidence intervals are geometric since that's what the simulator
#'   outputs (see an AUC tab and the summary statistics; these values are the
#'   ones for, e.g., "90\% confidence interval around the geometric mean(lower
#'   limit)").
#' @param includeTrialMeans TRUE or FALSE (default) for whether to include the
#'   range of trial means for a given parameter. Note: This is calculated from
#'   individual values rather than being pulled directly from the output.
#' @param concatVariability TRUE or FALSE (default) for whether to concatenate
#'   the variability. If "TRUE", the output will be formatted into a single row
#'   and listed as the lower confidence interval or percentile to the upper CI
#'   or percentile, e.g., "2400 to 2700". Please note that the current
#'   SimcypConsultancy template lists one row for each of the upper and lower
#'   values, so this should be set to FALSE for official reports.
#' @param sim_enz_dataframe the data.frame of enzyme abundance data obtained
#'   from running the function \code{\link{extractEnzAbund}}. Not quoted.
#' @param figure_type_enz type of figure to plot for the enzyme-abundance graph.
#'   Options are the same as for the substrate.
#' @param time_range_enz time range to show relative to the start of the
#'   simulation for the graph of the enzyme abundance. Options are the same as
#'   for the substrate.
#' @param x_axis_interval_enz optionally set the x-axis major tick-mark interval
#'   for the graph of the enzyme abundance Acceptable input: any number or leave
#'   as NA to accept default values, which are generally reasonable guesses as
#'   to aesthetically pleasing and PK-relevant intervals.
#' @param y_axis_label_enz optionally supply a character vector or an expression
#'   to use for the y axis label for the graph of the enzyme abundance
#' @param linear_or_log_enz the type of enzyme-abundance graph to be returned.
#'   Options are the same as for the substrate plot.
#' @param legend_label_enz optionally indicate on the legend of the graph of the
#'   enzyme abundance whether the perpetrator is an inhibitor, inducer,
#'   activator, or suppressor. Input will be used as the label in the legend for
#'   the line style and the shape. If left as the default NA when a legend is
#'   included and a perpetrator is present, the label in the legend will be
#'   "Inhibitor".
