#' Create some draft text to insert into the methods section of a report
#' describing the trial design of a simulation
#'
#'
#'
#' @param sim_data_file name of the Excel file containing the simulator output,
#'   in quotes
#' @param existing_exp_details the output from running either
#'   \code{\link{extractExpDetails}} or \code{\link{extractExpDetails_mult}} --
#'   either is fine as long as it contains details for \code{sim_data_file}.
#' @param prettify_compound_names TRUE (default) or FALSE for whether to make
#'   compound names prettier in legend entries and in any Word output files.
#'   This was designed for simulations where the substrate and any metabolites,
#'   perpetrators, or perpetrator metabolites are among the standard options for
#'   the simulator, and leaving \code{prettify_compound_names = TRUE} will make
#'   the name of those compounds something more human readable. For example,
#'   "SV-Rifampicin-MD" will become "rifampicin", and "Sim-Midazolam" will
#'   become "midazolam". 
#' @param default_cmpd_file Was one of the default compound files used for the
#'   substrate (if this was a perpetrator simulation) or the perpetrator (if
#'   this was a victim simulation)? TRUE (default) or FALSE. The only thing this
#'   affects is the sentence in the template report text, "The default compound
#'   library file for XXX was used."
#' @param victim_sim TRUE (default) or FALSE for whether this was a victim DDI
#'   simulation, so "TRUE" means that the client's drug was the victim. The only
#'   thing this affects is the sentence in the template report text "Performance
#'   verification of the XXX model is provided in Appendix B - Performance
#'   Verification of CYP3A Substrates, Inhibitors and Inducers." If this was a
#'   victim DDI simulation, then this sentence will replace "XXX" with the name
#'   of the perpetrator. If not, it will replace "XXX" with the name of the
#'   substrate.
