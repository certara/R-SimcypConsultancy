# Background

For estimating the sample size required, the means and standard deviations for the control and test conditions were calculated and used to estimate the pooled standard deviation (Equation 1) and, subsequently, the Cohen's d effect size (Equation 2). 

*Equation 1.* 

$$ \sigma_{\text{pooled}} = \sqrt{ \frac{(n_{1} - 1) \times (\sigma_1)^2 + (n_2-1) \times (\sigma_2)^2}{n_1 + n_2 - 2}} $$

where x~1~ and x~2~ are the individual observations in the two groups being compared (baseline and with the DDI), n~1~ and n~2~ are the number of observations in each group, and &sigma;~1~ and &sigma;~2~ are the standard deviations for the groups. 

*Equation 2.* 

$$ d = \frac{\mu_1 - \mu_2}{\sigma_{\text{pooled}}} $$

where &mu;~1~ and &mu;~2~ are the means of each of the groups. 

Hedge's correction g, which results in an unbiased estimate for small sample sizes (n < 20) and makes no appreciable difference for large sample sizes (Lakens 2013), was subsequently applied as a factor to estimate the corrected Cohen's d effect size (Equation 3). 

*Equation 3.* 

$$ g = d \times \left(1 - \frac{3}{4(n_1 + n_2)-9} \right) $$

where n is the number of pairs of observations. 

The pwr.t.test function from the pwr package in R (Cohen 1988), which estimates study power using a t distribution, was used to determine the number of samples required for &alpha; = `r alpha` (Type I error of `r alpha*100`\%) and power (1- &beta;) = `r power` (sensitivity of `r power*100`\%) for the corrected Cohen's d effect size.
