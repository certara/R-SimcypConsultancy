# Induction models available -- CHANGE THE TEXT BELOW AS NEEDED FOR YOUR REPORT

***Note:*** *Some of these models will give you Ind~max~ and some will give you E~max~, so pay careful attention to which parameter each model fits. The Simcyp Simulator uses Ind~max~ as input. For converting between the two: $Ind_{max} = E_{max} + 1$ and IndC~50~ is the same thing as EC~50~.*

Four induction models (Equations 1, 2, 3, and 4) were fit to the *in vitro* induction data. 

*Equation 1. E~max~ model* 

$$ \text{fold induction} = 1 + \frac{E_{max} \times I}{EC_{50} + I} $$ 

where I is the concentration of the inducer, E~max~ is the maximum change in fold induction, and EC~50~ is the concentration of the inducer that elicits half the maximum fold-change in induction. 

*Equation 2. E~max~ slope model* 

$$ \text{fold induction} = 1 + E_{max} \times \frac{I^\gamma}{EC_{50}^\gamma + I^\gamma} $$

where I is the concentration of the inducer, E~max~ is the maximum change in fold induction, EC~50~ is the concentration of the inducer that elicits half the maximum fold-change in induction, and &gamma; is the Hill equation coefficient describing the slope. 

*Equation 3. Slope model* 

$$ \text{fold induction} = 1 + I \times n $$

where I is the concentration of the inducer and n is the slope. 

*Equation 4. Sigmoidal three-parameter model* 

$$ \text{fold induction} = \frac{Ind_{max}}{1 + e^{ \frac{IndC_{50}-I}{\gamma}}} $$

where I is the concentration of the inducer, Ind~max~ is the maximum fold induction, IndC~50~ is the concentration of the inducer that elicits half the maximum fold induction, and &gamma; is the Hill equation coefficient describing the slope.
